         <p>Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father, and raised in Pretoria,
            South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving
            to Canada at age 17 to avoid conscription. He was enrolled at Queen's University 
            and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a 
             bachelor's degree in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend
             Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the
             web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq 
             for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, which 
             merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 
            2002 for $1.5 billion.</p>
